# Phase 5 Completion Report: Voice-Score Service Refactoring

## Overview

This report summarizes the completed work for Phase 5 of the Pronunciation Assessment Implementation Plan. Phase 5 focused on refactoring the Voice-Score service to integrate with the alignment and pronunciation scorer services, along with implementing MongoDB storage and performance optimizations.

## Key Accomplishments

### Proto Definition Updates
- ✅ Updated `voice.proto` to include phoneme-level information
- ✅ Added alignment results and phoneme-level details to response structure
- ✅ Created new service interface definitions for detailed evaluation
- ✅ Added health check endpoint to service definition

### Core Functionality Updates
- ✅ Refactored existing scoring logic to be optional/fallback
- ✅ Implemented integration with alignment service via gRPC client
- ✅ Implemented integration with pronunciation scorer service via gRPC client
- ✅ Updated transcription logic to return more detailed information
- ✅ Added support for multiple languages and regional variants

### Storage and Performance Optimization
- ✅ Implemented MongoDB storage for all services
  - ✅ MongoDB client implementations with connection pooling
  - ✅ MongoDB cache with TTL support for all services
  - ✅ GridFS for audio file storage
- ✅ Updated factory methods for configurable storage backends
- ✅ Created Kubernetes configurations for MongoDB-enabled services
- ✅ Optimized model loading and initialization
  - ✅ Model manager for alignment service with lazy loading
  - ✅ Model manager for pronunciation scorer service
  - ✅ Memory management for large models
  - ✅ GPU/CPU fallback mechanisms
- ✅ Implemented resource usage monitoring and throttling
  - ✅ Resource monitor with CPU/memory tracking
  - ✅ Adaptive concurrency limits
  - ✅ Circuit breaker pattern for overload protection
  - ✅ Request rate tracking and throttling

### Testing & Documentation
- ✅ Created unit and integration tests
  - ✅ Unit tests for voice-score service
  - ✅ Integration tests for the entire pipeline
  - ✅ Mock testing for service dependencies
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation
  - ✅ MongoDB migration guide
  - ✅ MongoDB deployment guide
  - ✅ API documentation
  - ✅ Deployment instructions

## Technical Details

### Proto Files Updated
- `/services/voice-score/proto/voice.proto`
- `/services/learning-service/proto/voice.proto`

### New Implementation Files

- `/services/alignment-service/app/model_manager.py` - Model optimization for alignment service

### Test Files
- `/services/voice-score/tests/test_server.py` - Unit tests
- `/services/voice-score/tests/integration_test.py` - Integration tests
- `/services/voice-score/run_tests.sh` - Test runner script

### Documentation
- `/docs/mongodb-migration.md` - MongoDB migration documentation
- `/docs/mongodb-deployment-guide.md` - Deployment guide for MongoDB services
- `/services/voice-score/README.md` - API documentation
- `/docs/pronunciation-pipeline-deployment.md` - Full pipeline deployment guide

## Next Steps

With Phase 5 complete, we're ready to move to Phase 6: Learning Service Integration. This will involve:

1. Creating clients for the alignment, pronunciation scorer, and TTS services in the learning service
2. Updating the learning service to use the three-stage pipeline
3. Updating the pass/fail threshold logic based on phoneme-level scoring
4. Implementing TTS generation for vocabulary items

## Conclusion

Phase 5 has successfully transformed the voice-score service into an orchestrator for the three-stage pronunciation assessment pipeline. The service now provides detailed phoneme-level feedback while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing API. The MongoDB migration provides better performance and reduced operational complexity by standardizing on a single database technology.
